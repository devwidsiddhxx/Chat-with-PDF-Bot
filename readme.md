# 💬 Chat with PDF using LangChain, Hugging Face & OpenRouter - Policy Reader

An intelligent, fully local PDF Question-Answering app built with **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **Hugging Face Embeddings**, and **OpenRouter (ChatGPT)**. Just upload your PDF(s), ask questions, and get context-aware answers instantly.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Extracts and indexes PDF content for question-answering
- ✅ Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from Hugging Face for fast, lightweight embeddings
- ✅ Stores vector embeddings locally using **FAISS**
- ✅ Semantic search for most relevant chunks
- ✅ ChatGPT (via OpenRouter) for accurate answers,Groq
- ✅ Clean and responsive UI with **Streamlit**
- ✅ Works entirely offline for retrieval (only API call is for LLM)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs**
   - Extracts and concatenates raw text using `PyPDF2`.

2. **Text Chunking**
   - Splits text using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (4,000 char chunks, 400 overlap).

3. **Embedding**
   - Generates sentence-level embeddings via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

4. **Store in FAISS**
   - Embeddings are stored in a local FAISS vector index.

5. **Ask a Question**
   - Your question is semantically compared to stored chunks using FAISS similarity search.

6. **Answer Generation**
   - Most relevant chunks + your question are sent to `gpt-3.5-turbo` via **OpenRouter**.
   - The model returns an accurate, context-aware response.
